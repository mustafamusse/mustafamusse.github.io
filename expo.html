              We are 8 students from KTH attending a course that revolves
              around working in a project where the outcome is to create a product.
              The idea is to simulate an engineer-like workspace.
              The product should be unique and introduce something new.
              One of our group members thought that it would be a great idea
              to create a game that aims towards educating children while being fun
              to play simultaneously. The best way to create a game that would be both
              educational and fun was an Escape-Room game.

              A couple of people from
              the group had been in an Escape-Room and they shared their experiences
              with the group in order to gain knowledge about how the layout of the
              game should be. Every group member had a chance to vote for the proposed
              idea and the majority voted for creating an Escape-Room-like game that
              would be educational. Our target group was kids between the ages of 13-16
              since we wanted to target a teenage audience. The game is designed
              to be difficult to complete (like all Escape Rooms are) with a number of
              different puzzles that should be completed in order to escape.

                The puzzles are created in a way that is educational since you have to use your
                logic together with math and programming skills to complete the puzzles.
                We designed the game according to a specific theme to make it more engaging and interesting,
                the theme we picked was ancient Egypt. This was done by coloring
                the walls according to the theme and adding objects such as coffins,
                pharaohs, tombs and much more.

              Like many games, we have three different
              difficulties in the game. The game starts in Easy mode which gives you 60 minutes
              to complete the game if the player is more experienced they can go into
              options and play the game in Medium (45 minutes) or Hard (30 minutes) mode.
              About halfway through the project, we were able to create a Beta-version of
              the game which we released to a hand-picked audience in order to gain feedback
              and thoughts about the game. We received good feedback and made adjustments accordingly.
              The game is now complete and it consists of four rooms, the player will escape once
              they completed all puzzles. Good luck and have fun!
