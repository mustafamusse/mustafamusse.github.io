            We are 8 students from KTH who wanted to create a fun game for kids and make it a learning experience
            at the same time. By putting our heads together we got the idea of creating a game inspired by
            Escape Room. An Escape Room is a gaming/virtual experience where you are trapped in a room and have to solve
            different puzzles in order to escape. Our goal was to create puzzles that are related to math or programming
            excercises while still maintaining the scary essence of the Escape Room. The theme of the game was inspired
            by the egyptian pyramids, we thought that being trapped in a pyramid would be scary enough to entice the player
            but not to a degree where the player would get nightmares, especially since our target group is kids between the ages of
            10-15. We hope that you enjoy this lovely creation of ours and we would appreciate all the feedback that we can get!
